I'm a Professor of the Practice and Associate Head in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/) at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/). 

I'm also the Director of Consulting at our [Data Science and AI Academy](https://go.ncsu.edu/dsa), working with the [NC State Libraries](https://lib.ncsu.edu) to co-direct our [data science consulting program](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/services/data-visualization/get-help). 

My research interests include developing best practices for teaching statistical consulting and collaboration and for organizing these efforts in higher education. I also enjoy doing collaborative statsitical work in a wide variety of sciences.

After earning my Ph.D. in statistics from NC State University in 2008, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Maryland. In 2009 I began working for the Criminal Justice Information Services Division in West Virginia, and in 2013 I returned to NC State as a professional track assistant professor. I was promoted to the associate level in 2018 and to Professor of the Practice in 2024.
